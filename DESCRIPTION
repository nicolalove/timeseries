Description: The timeseries package is a data visualization package that currently only 
            contains `qtseries()` and the `qstacktseries` functions.The `qtseries()` function creates a 
            point & line time series plot using `ggplot()`, where the x-axis is time (in years) and the 
            y-axis the variable of interest, grouped by a specified variable. The `qstacktseries` function creates a stacked area plot using 
            `ggplot()`, where the x-axis is time (in years) and the y-axis the variable of interest, 
            grouped by a specified variable. This package is useful in the initial stages of data exploration 
            when users are trying to discover interesting temporal relationships in their data.
