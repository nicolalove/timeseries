Description: The timeseries package is a data visualization package that currently only 
            contains `qtseries()` function.The `qtseries()` function creates time series plots 
            using `ggplot()`, where the x-axis is time (in years) and the y-axis the variable of 
            interest.This package is useful in the initial stages of data exploration when users 
            are trying to discover interesting temporal relationships in their data.
